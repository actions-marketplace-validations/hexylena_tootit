# TootIt, a collaborative tooting experience

By writing markdown documents placed in `inbox/`, you can automatically convert these into toots!

## Features

- Automatic threading, if a post is longer than 500 characters, it will be split
- Automatic thread offset counters (e.g. a 1/3 added to the end of your toot)
- Image uploading (local files or via URL) with alt text (mandatory)
- Support for toot metadata
    - Language
    - Content Warning
- Will only toot a toot after it's date has passed, allowing pre-prepared toots to be edited right up until their posting date
